## Curriculum Curation
- If you have specific feedback on the curriculum, ex: add/remove a course
- If you would like to introduce a new branch or stream

Please [open an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) with the details.

Before opening a new issue, please keep the following in mind:
- OLI prioritizes courses that are highly-rated, free and self-paced
- Check that the same issue is not already open/closed
- In your new issue:
    * Cover all relevant details and make sure they fit the OLI curriculum criteria
    * Follow the format and highlight the details of each course (elective, language etc.)

## Minor Changes
If you have minor updates to make to any of the website pages or the curriculum (ex: spelling/grammatical errors, a broken course link), please send a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) to fix the mistake. For those who are new to GitHub, check out this short FreeCodeCamp tutorial on [making your first pull request](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/).
