### About Open Learn India
Many schools and colleges were quick to move online with their classes during the lockdown. But, not all students across India have had a smooth transition. Any student with access to the internet should be able to continue their learning without stress. This crowdsourced catalog of resources hopes to leverage freely available open online content, that can supplement the studentâ€™s formal curriculum.

While there is high-quality educational content available today on the internet, the most pressing issue a common student faces is deciding on the right course. This is not an easy task given the hours and hours of content coming up on the web each day. Open Learn India curates the resources to loosely map with the Indian education curriculum, to make the process of selecting the course simple.

The idea is to get the student to spend more time learning and less time anxious about the overwhelming content on the internet.

#### Content Curators
Volunteers - Students and alumni from Tier-1, Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges across North, South, East, West and Central India.
