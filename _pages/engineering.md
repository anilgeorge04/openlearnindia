Welcome to the Home Page for Engineering. Today, we cover 5 primary branches. AICTE reports suggest that over 88% of Engineering students in India enrol in one of the following 5 branches. If your specific branch is not listed below, we recommend picking the branch closest to your curriculum.

**Example:**
- An Automobile Engineering student can pick <a href="/engineering/mechanical/">Mechanical</a>
- An Information Technology student can pick <a href="/engineering/computer/">Computer Science</a>
