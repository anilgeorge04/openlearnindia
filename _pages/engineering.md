[AISHE reports](https://www.education.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/statistics-new/AISHE%20Final%20Report%202018-19.pdf) suggest that over 87% of Engineering students in Public & Private colleges in India enrol in one of the following 5 branches. All students also share <a href="/engineering/0_common/">Common Foundation</a> subjects in their 1st year.

If your specific branch is not listed below, we recommend picking the branch closest to your curriculum.

**Example:**
- An Automobile Engineering student can pick <a href="/engineering/mechanical/">Mechanical</a>
- An Information Technology student can pick <a href="/engineering/computer/">Computer Science</a>
