# Open Learn India

An open source repository of free resources available online, loosely mapped with the Indian curriculum

# Primary Motive
Many schools and colleges were quick to move online with their classes during the lockdown. But, not all students across India have had a smooth transition. Any student with access to the internet should be able to continue their learning without stress. This crowdsourced catalogue hopes to leverage freely available open online content, that can supplement the student's formal curriculum.

### Content Curators
Volunteers - Students and alumni from Tier-1, Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges in India.
